This project includes the consumer producer problem. There are three files since shared memory is required. The file shared.h is accessed by the producer and consumer. It has a structure declared with two integers values declared and two sem_t variables declared. The producer has the two int you want to put in the consumer (10,11). The consumer has semaphores and uses mutual exclusion. Both files have char *shmpath = "Mem_Name2" which is shared. Once the commnads are run, the terminal outputs the 10 and 11.
